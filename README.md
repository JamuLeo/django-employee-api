The CRUD project is designed to provide a simple yet robust system for managing employee records. Users can perform the following operations:

Create: Add new employees to the system by providing essential details such as name, home district, and salary.

Read: Retrieve employee information, either as a complete list or individually by ID.

Update: Modify existing employee records, allowing updates to any field.

Delete: Remove employee records from the system permanently.
